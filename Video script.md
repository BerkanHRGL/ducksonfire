<p style="text-align: left"></p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Lars, what exactly is Ducks On Fire?</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>LARS:</strong><br>We're not just another creative agency. We're explorers at the frontier where film meets gaming technology. What you're seeing isn't a static concept art - these are real-time rendered environments that respond to our cameras, our lighting, our creative vision in the moment.</p><p style="text-align: left">We have this massively talented and diverse group of filmmakers and virtual production developers. My job is to orchestrate these incredible talents into something that will revolutionize how stories are told. We're not just making content - we're redefining what's possible in storytelling.</p><hr><p style="text-align: left"><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Gabriel, walk us through what you actually create here.</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>GABRIEL:</strong><br>I create assets that live seamlessly between game engines and film sets - digital objects so real they become part of the story.</p><p style="text-align: left">Every texture, every detail has to hold up under cinematic lighting and real-time rendering. When a director says "I want a thousand of these floating in space," I make that happen without breaking the budget or the timeline.</p><hr><p style="text-align: left"><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Pleun, how do you approach building these virtual worlds?</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>PLEUN:</strong><br>I build immersive worlds in real-time, where directors can walk through and film their scenes before a single camera rolls. Traditional filmmaking means you build sets and hope they work. We let you preview the space, adjust the lighting, move mountains if needed - all before you call "action."</p><p style="text-align: left">Using Gabriel's assets, I'm essentially world-building with the same tools game developers use, but with cinematic quality and film production workflows in mind. Every environment tells a story, sets a mood, becomes a character itself.</p><hr><p style="text-align: left"><strong>INTERVIEWER:</strong> Berkan, what's it like shooting in these virtual environments?</p><p style="text-align: left"><strong>BERKAN:</strong><br>I bridge the gap between traditional cinematography and virtual worlds, using real-time engines to capture impossible shots and bring directors' wildest visions to life.</p><p style="text-align: left">It's not replacing traditional cinematography - it's expanding what cinematography can be.</p><hr><p style="text-align: left"><strong>LARS:</strong><br>The future of media will be unleashing creativity unlike anything before.<br><br>We are looking forward to work with clients. Our choices are:<br>1. Iron Films<br>2. Maarten van t Veer<br>3. Dragon's Den</p><hr><p style="text-align: left"><strong>GABRIEL:</strong> We create the impossible...<br><strong>PLEUN:</strong> We build infinite worlds...<br><strong>BERKAN:</strong> We capture every vision...<br><strong>LARS:</strong> We are Ducks On Fire.</p>
